Description
The donation of blood is important because most often people requiring blood do not receive it on time causing loss of life. Examples include severe accidents, patients suffering from dengue or malaria, or organ transplants. Extreme health conditions such as Leukemia and bone marrow cancer, where affected individuals experience sudden high blood loss and need an urgent supply of blood and do not have it can also lead to loss of life. Sound data-driven systems for tracking and predicting donations and supply needs can improve the entire supply chain, making sure that more patients get the blood transfusions they need, which can reduce mortality risk.

One of the interesting aspects about blood is that it is not a typical commodity. First, there is the perishable nature of blood. Grocery stores face the dilemma of perishable products such as milk, which can be challenging to predict accurately so as to not lose sales due to expiration. Blood has a shelf life of approximately 42 days according to the American Red Cross (Darwiche, Feuilloy et al. 2010). However, what makes this problem more challenging than milk is the stochastic behavior of blood supply to the system as compared to the more deterministic nature of milk supply. Whole blood is often split into platelets, red blood cells, and plasma, each having their own storage requirements and shelf life. For example, platelets must be stored around 22 degrees Celsius, while red blood cells 4 degree Celsius, and plasma at -25 degrees Celsius. Moreover, platelets can often be stored for at most 5 days, red blood cells up to 42 days, and plasma up to a calendar year.
